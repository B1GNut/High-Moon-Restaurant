       <B>It has been almost a year since High Moon Restaurant reopened as a plant-based restaurant with an emphatic, 
       	  <br> renewed mission. This chapter has been the most exciting time of my entire career as a chef.

          <br>
          Cooking plant-based has been meaningful and expansive. We are writing an entirely new language, one that challenges us to be creative and continuously learn. <br> It’s exciting to cook and eat this way; what we first thought might be limiting has proven instead to be invigorating. In my mind, there is no doubt that the food at <br> High Moon Restaurant today is the best it has ever been; it’s an experience not found anywhere else.
          <br>

          I made the commitment to use our creativity towards a plant-based future because that’s where our food system needs to go. I am not a scientist, nor climate change expert, <br> but I am a chef. I see the shift happening to our world first-hand in the quality and availability of ingredients, and how they are sourced. Something has to change.<br>  We need to rethink the norms, rewrite the rules. This way of eating is better for the planet and our health—and it is delicious.
          <br> 
          What could be the impact if we all ate plant-based food more often? We don’t need to eat like this every day, but just one day per week can have an immediate positive effect. <br> It’s not a new idea, but it has become more urgent. Let’s start with one day. This thinking is not anti-meat, but it is pro-planet.
          <br> 
          We're excited to share a way to make this a reality. We are starting small, but this is just the beginning.
